                        In Sicily, as temperatures drop with mild days and even colder nights Carmelo’s Mandarin, Navel and Cara Cara transition from their intensely aromatic ‘green state’ to their ripe orange state, where sweetness is more pronounced with lower levels of acidity. His Tacle Mandarins also come into season, a less known variety and mix of the Clementine and Tarocco, which itself is a variety soon to arrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       From the eastern coast of the island, we receive two varieties from Salvatore; Cedros, with their prized sweet, tender pith and Kumquats, bringing bright acidity and sweetness with slight tartness. Soon to follow will be his giant, Kumquat ‘Di Giarre.’ From Sicily’s north coast, Pink Grapefruits, grown by another Salvatore carry a slightly more bitter sweet profile with flesh holding a deep pink pigmentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further Italian varieties available are Bergamots and Clementines both from Calabria. Whilse from the south of Spain in Murcia we receive Tiger Lemons, Finger Limes, Yuzu, Buddha's Hands and Meyer Lemons, along with our latest addition from Seville, the Seville Orange.
